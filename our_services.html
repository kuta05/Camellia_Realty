  <h4> For Buyers </h4>

If you are on a market to buy, there are a few things you need to know. 
<p><b>Hiring a Realtor </b> </br>
I will do a consultation to learn about your needs so we can understand how best to help you achieve your goals. I will work on your behalf and look out for you best interest and negotiate to get you the best deal possible.
<p> <b>Securing Financing</b> </br>
Establish a lender to work with. They will ask for personal financial documents to determine how much you may qualify for. Request a pre-approval letter to save time and strengthen your standings during negotiations. Many selling agents will require a pre-approval letter attached to any offers.
<p> <b>Finding Your Perfect Home</b> </br>
I will setup a filtered search in the Triangle Multiple Listings Service based on your personal criteria for your ideal home. You will receive a list of available homes. You will also immediately get instant notifications by email whenever news homes become available on the open market.
<p> <b>Make & Negotiate an Offer</b> </br>
Once together we find your perfect home, we will evaluate the market value of the property to help determine a good offer price. I will guide you through the entire process of negotiations, offers and counter-offers. I will explain in detail the offer to purchase agreement including things like due diligence and earnest money deposit.
<p> <b>Due Diligence</b> </br>
The due diligence period is a time when the buyer may work on inspections: Home; Pest; Radon. You will officially begin the mortgage application for a loan. The lender may setup an appraisal, and the underwriter will verify all your financials to decide on the loan approval. After inspections, we may request repairs on potential damages found. We will need to setup your home insurance with an insurance company.
<p> <b>Closing </b> </br>
I will assist you in arranging for closing with a reputable real estate attorney. After the final walkthrough, we will proceed to closing. Documents will be signed by both parties and you will receive the keys. The attorney will record the deed of trust with the county. Hooray you are all set!
