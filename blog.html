  <h4>Wake County Home Values Go Up</br> 
  <small> November 11, 2019 </small></h4>
  <p> Wake County has begun notifying residents of their property’s new value, and most people should expect a bump in their assessments.On average, homes in Wake County increased 20% in value from four years ago, and commercial properties increased 33%. This is Wake County’s first revaluation of property since 2016. State law requires counties to assess every eight years, but Wake County has chosen to undergo the task every four years to better reflect market values, or how much a property could be sold for “in an open and competitive market.”</p>
